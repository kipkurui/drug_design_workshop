# Unraveling the application of computers in solving computational problems: A Hands-On Workshop on Genomics and Bioinformatics

We are planning the Drug Design Workshop/hackathon at Kenyatta University on May 9th and 10th, 2024. 

## Introduction
Genomics has revolutionized the field of biology, enabling researchers to unravel the complexities of genetic information across diverse organisms. Bioinformatics, the interdisciplinary field that combines biology with computer science, plays a pivotal role in analyzing and interpreting genomic data. In light of the growing importance of genomics and bioinformatics in modern biological research, we propose organizing a workshop aimed at equipping participants with essential skills and tools to navigate the genomic and proteomics landscape through bioinformatics techniques. This will be a key step towards understanding the modern drug design process geared towards finding novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.

## Workshop
The workshop will focus on the fundamentals of _in silico_ drug design, explore the application of machine learning in drug discovery, and dive into the fascinating world of bioinformatics. Additionally, we have an exciting group activity planned to collaborate on data mining of natural compounds from East Africa, putting our newfound skills into practice.

**Topics:**
1. Introduction to Bioinformatics: Biological and literature search
2. Introduction to Genomics
3. Introduction to _in silico_ drug design
4. Application of Bioinformatics in Drug Discovery
5. Practical session: Use of Online Resources in drug discovery
