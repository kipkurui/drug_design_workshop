# From Genomics to Drug Design Workshop

We are planning the Drug Design Workshop/hackathon at Kenyatta University on Februry 15th and 16th 2024. 

## Introduction
Africa is home to an astonishing array of plant species, boasting over 45,000 varieties, according to Klopper et al. (2007). This remarkable biodiversity holds the promise of being a valuable source of novel anti-cancer drugs. Specifically, the East African region, with its rich natural plant diversity, presents a unique opportunity for drug discovery.

However, this potential remains largely untapped, as computational methods have not been fully utilized in exploring this invaluable resource. This workshop aims to bridge that gap by equipping students and researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to harness the power of computational techniques in the discovery of novel drugs from natural compounds.

## Workshop
The workshop will focus on the fundamentals of _in silico_ drug design, explore the application of machine learning in drug discovery, and dive into the fascinating world of bioinformatics. Additionally, we have an exciting group activity planned to collaborate on data mining of natural compounds from East Africa, putting our newfound skills into practice.

**Topics:**
1. Introduction to Bioinformatics: Biological and literature search
2. Introduction to Genomics
3. Introduction to _in silico_ drug design
4. Application of Bioinformatics in Drug Discovery
5. Practical session: Use of Online Resources in drug discovery
